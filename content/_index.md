# Welcome to the Axelerant Engineering Handbook

This handbook is not a guide nor a tutorial for a specific language or technology we use at Axelerant. This handbook aims to show to an engineer at Axelerant what we value. It says who we are and how we work. It helps you understand what you need to do to succeed at Axelerant.

We will avoid diving deep into specific technologies and instead link to resources and references that will do the job. Reading those references is an important part of reading this handbook.
