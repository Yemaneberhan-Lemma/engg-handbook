# Axelerant Engineering Handbook

This handbook is not a guide nor a tutorial for a specific language or technology we use at Axelerant. This handbook aims to show to an engineer at Axelerant what we value. It says who we are and how we work. It helps you understand what you need to do to succeed at Axelerant.

We will avoid diving deep into specific technologies and instead link to resources and references that will do the job. Reading those references is an important part of reading this handbook.

We begin by describing the [principles that we follow]({{< relref "docs/principles" >}}) when working at Axelerant. We further elaborate on some of those principles in the next section which is to do with [behaviors we expect from each other]({{< relref "docs/behaviors" >}}). This is followed by a section on [being productive]({{< relref "docs/productivity" >}}). While the target audience for these sections are engineers (like the rest of the handbook), these three sections are probably suitable for all Axelerant team members.

We then begin with general guidelines on technical topics. As mentioned before, we have tried to keep the specific methods out of the scope except when those methods are ubiquitous (such as [git]({{< relref "docs/how-we-work/git" >}})) in the industry or at Axelerant.

## Contributing to the handbook

You can suggest any changes to any of the pages by clicking on the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of each page. You can also use [Github](https://github.com/axelerant/engg-handbook) to add new pages to the handbook. As an engineer, you might want to clone the repo in your own environment (or use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/axelerant/engg-handbook)) to make changes.

We welcome all contributions to the handbook, including from people outside Axelerant. That said, this handbook is meant to be opinionated and a (relatively) long-term guide. This is why we may not be able to accept all the changes we receive. Please read the above section to discern the intention of this handbook and hopefully, that can explain why we may not be able to accept your contribution.

In all cases, we follow the principles we have written here in responding to the contributions as well. Specifically, in case we can't straight-away accept your contribution, we aim to be kind by working with you to change your contribution so that it can be accepted. We do that by sharing feedback about why we can't accept your contribution as-is.
