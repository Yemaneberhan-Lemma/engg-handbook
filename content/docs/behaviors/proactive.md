# We don't wait to be told

As an engineer, we take pride in the maturity and quality of our work. After all, our work is our expression of our creativity. It is not _just_ a product of someone else's direction. We are intelligent, decisive, and mature human beings, and we understand the business and the technology. We don't wait to be told how to do our work. We jump in enthusiastically and take it to completion.

For example, you are working on a task. You are stuck with a weird error. You are not sure what is causing it. You have spent hours on it, but you have not made progress. Spending hours is not an efficient way. It might impact the deadline. You have given your best - that's it. Now it is time to [reach out to your peers]({{< relref "docs/behaviors/ask-for-help.md" >}}) for help.

Proactive communication is essential for effective teamwork. We need to stay connected with peers and stakeholders, especially during bandwidth constraints, leaves, or changes in estimation. We need to be transparent about risks and timelines. If we timely update stakeholders it will prevent surprises and will foster trust. We always prefer to collaborate, adapt, and keep everyone informed to ensure successful project delivery.
