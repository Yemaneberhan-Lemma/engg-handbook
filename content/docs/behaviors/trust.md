# Openness to Build Trust

As developers, we always seek the best solution for our projects, and we often face surprising issues we can resolve immediately or issues that may take longer to resolve. The most important thing that we need to do right away after we feel that the issue we are facing is going to affect our timeline or result, is communicate with the team leader or senior ones to find a solution or be on the same page.

It is vital to be transparent about how we work, how we manage our tasks, or even how we resolve issues. We should also be open to feedback or suggestions. It is recommended to over communicate rather than not communicate. When we communicate, involve stakeholders, and are on the same page, it can create an environment where team members feel valued and heard, leading to increased trust and collaboration within the team.

Just like the saying "The squeaky wheel gets the grease", the person who speaks up about their needs is most likely to get what they want. In the coding world, as technologies change and business requirements grow, there is no manual that gives you all the answers. It is almost mandatory to refer to various resources to obtain results. And most of the resources we use come from people who are willing to share their challenges and who are willing to lend a hand. At Axelerant, the environment is collaborative, and there are various channels that enable us to ask for help and contribute.

We all face challenges, and sometimes we need to seek help from the respective open-source community, say Drupal.org. We prefer posting such challenges in the community (and sometimes with code-patches, if applicable). This little act does not only support the person who posted the challenge but also the people who will face the same challenge in the future. Furthermore, this can also prompt the code contributors to fix the challenge in the upcoming versions.
