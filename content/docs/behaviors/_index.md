# Behaviors we expect from each other

At Axelerant, we highly value the quality of the code delivered by the engineer. But it is equally important to note that you are not writing the code in a vacuum. You will collaborate with your peers, closely work with your manager and give demonstrations to the customer. That means behavioral traits become as important as your technical capabilities.

## We own everything in our world

> "Once people stop making excuses, stop blaming others, and take ownership of everything in their lives, they are compelled to take action to solve their problems." - _Extreme Ownership_, Jocko Willink, Leif Babin

As an engineer, we pick up a task and see it to completion. Completion doesn't mean that you implement what you were asked to do and call it a day. It means things like the following and a lot more.

- You take into account the areas of the application it will impact.
- You determine in what scenarios the particular feature can fail or otherwise cause the system to misbehave.
- You figure out and document the steps required to deploy it in production.
- You write automated tests for that feature.
- You write any upgrade paths required to support that feature.
- Ultimately, and most importantly, you determine if this feature is fulfilling the customer's problem as far as you can tell.

In a nutshell, you own the feature. You are obligated to share suggestions on how to improve it.

### You're not alone

Taking ownership doesn't mean you're alone. You realize when it is time to research options yourself and when it is time to ask your team for help, and you do it. It doesn't mean you know everything. It means you know what you know and you know what you don't. And you ask for help. It also means that you speak up when you see something that affects your system or your team. We're in this together; all of us, and remaining quiet is doing a disservice.

## We step up and speak up

> "They don't understand that Excellence isn't about working extra hard to do what you're told. It's about taking the initiative to do work you decide is worth doing." - _Poke the Box_, Seth Godin

When we take ownership of a system, we choose to do our best with it. Remaining quiet when we see a problem is not something we do. We actively seek the hardest problems that are worth solving and we speak up when we see something that affects our system.

You are in the midst of a client meeting. There is a decision taken that is going to impact a specific area of the application. But, nobody has raised the concern.

There is a feeling of uncomfortableness during a discussion where you are finding a pause to speak. Or, you might think the issue is obvious, and the client will realize it later. These feelings will stop you from bringing up the concern in the meeting.

Shake off those feelings. Share your observations right away. At Axelerant, we highly value stepping outside our comfort zone.

## Being proactive

> "Please stop waiting for a map. We reward those who draw maps, not those who follow them." - _Poke the Box_, Seth Godin

You are working on a task. You are stuck with a weird error. You are not sure what is causing it. You have spent hours on it, but you have not made progress.

Spending hours is not an efficient way. It might impact the deadline. You have given your best - that's it. Now it is time to [reach out to your peers]({{< ref "../principles/ask-for-help.md" >}}) for help.

## We demonstrate kindness

> "The mark of a wild heart is living out the paradox of love in our lives. It's the ability to be tough and tender, excited and scared, brave and afraidâ€“all in the same moment. It's showing up in our vulnerability and our courage, being both fierce and kind." - _Braving the Wilderness_, Brene Brown

Your peer has accidentally deleted the content on production. Instead of being hard on the person, ask for their support to resolve the problem. You have empowered that person with your act of kindness.

### Kindness, not niceness

If you're not speaking up because you don't want to _look_ like a bad person, you're probably being nice, not kind. You're witholding something that affects everyone else and that is not kindness. At Axelerant, kindness is required. It needs to be delivered in the most appropriate language and the most appropriate environment, but chosing not to say anything is not acceptable.
