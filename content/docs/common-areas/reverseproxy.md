## Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to those servers. A reverse proxy can help increase the security, performance, and reliability of web services by performing tasks such as load balancing, caching, compression, encryption, and firewall protection. A reverse proxy can also hide the existence and characteristics of the origin servers from clients. A reverse proxy is different from a forward proxy, which is a server that sits in front of a group of client machines and forwards their requests to the web servers. A forward proxy is typically used by clients to bypass network restrictions or protect their identity, while a reverse proxy is typically used by web services to improve their scalability and resilience.

Some of the pros of using a reverse proxy are:
- It can improve performance by caching frequently accessed content, reducing the load on the web server.
- It can increase security by hiding the origin IP address and the server information, filtering malicious requests, blocking DDoS attacks, and handling encryption and decryption.
- It can provide scalability by distributing traffic among multiple servers and performing health checks on them.
- It can support more complex and dynamic rules like behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, and machine learning.


Some of the cons of using a reverse proxy are:
- It can impact performance due to the processing of each request and response between the client and the server.
- It can become a single point of failure if not properly configured, monitored, and maintained.
- It can have compatibility issues with some web applications or protocols, such as WebSocket, HTTP/2, or client-side certificates.
- It can increase the complexity and cost of the web application architecture due to the need for additional hardware, software, or cloud services.
