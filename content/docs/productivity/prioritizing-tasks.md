# Prioritizing Tasks

When prioritizing tasks, first address issues in the LIVE/Production environment. Critical and high-priority bugs should also be given attention, even if they are not in Production. If a client demo is approaching, prioritize those tasks accordingly.

Utilize the Daily Standup Meeting (DSM) to clarify which tasks need prioritization if unsure, or to inform the team about the issues you are working on. When working on multiple tasks, inform the Project Manager (PM) to plan a release with all tasks going to Production, which should be done post-estimation. Ensure the task is classified correctly as a bug or a regular task, as bugs are not estimated and are not chargeable.

Currently, tasks are handled individually and pushed to Production as there are no multiple tasks simultaneously. However, if more than one task needs to be pushed to Production, a release planning should be done.
