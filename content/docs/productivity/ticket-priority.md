# Prioritizing Tickets

When prioritizing tickets, first address issues in the LIVE/Production environment. Critical and high-priority bugs should also be given attention, even if they are not in Production. If a client demo is approaching, prioritize those tickets accordingly.

Utilize the Daily Standup Meeting (DSM) to clarify which tickets need prioritization if unsure, or to inform the team about the issues you are working on. When working on multiple tickets, inform the Project Manager (PM) to plan a Release with all tickets going to Production, which should be done post-estimation. Ensure the ticket is classified as a bug or a task, as bugs are not estimated and are not chargeable.

Currently, tickets are handled individually and pushed to Production as there are no multiple tickets simultaneously. However, if more than one ticket needs to be pushed to Production, a Release planning should be done.
