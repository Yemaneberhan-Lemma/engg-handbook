# Dealing with Distractions

We live in a wonderful time where you can reach out to your teammates living on the other side of the globe within seconds. Unfortunately, that also means someone can reach out to you on a whim as well. They can't see that you're busy and deep into debugging a function 17 layers deep. And one interruption is enough to demolish the mental model you're building.

It is commonly found that we need about 45 minutes to find our state of flow even after a moment's interruption. How then do we manage our distractions?

## Know your enemy

First, we have to realize that we don't fight distractions. We avoid them. Fighting distractions is a losing battle and you can only win by planning ahead and avoiding distractions.

Then, you have to be mindful that of your time. Have you gone down a rabbithole? Are you focusing on tangents not important to your work? Are you working on something that doesn't help your most important goal for the day? It is difficult to guard ourselves all the time but we can do this every few minutes. When you catch yourself distracted, reassess your priorities. Ask yourself: is this helping me achieve my goals today? If not, tell yourself to take a step back and rethink your priorities.

## Understand yourself

Just as we discussed in the [time management section]({{< relref "time" >}}), figure out your most productive hours and guard yourself against distractions. Ensure you don't have meetings at the time. It's a good idea to block your calendar for those hours so the rest of your team has clarity. There are tools that integrate Slack status with the calendar which you can use to indicate on Slack that you are not to be disturbed. If possible, quit Slack and silence your phone at this time.

## Working with tools

### Slack

Slack is our primary tool for communication and as such, it is quite noisy. Thankfully, the default notification settings have improved significantly since their earlier versions.
