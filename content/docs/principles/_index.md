# Principles of Software Development at Axelerant

{{< blockquote author="Ray Dalio" quote="Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life." >}}

As software engineers, we have to make a lot of decisions throughout the day. Defining and following certain _principles_ makes it easier for us to make many of the decisions for challenges that have been solved previously. These are not set in stone, but they have stood the test of time, and we would rarely, if ever, ignore a principle, and only if thereâ€™s a very good reason.

## Values

Before we discuss our principles in engineering, make sure you have understood our values of Enthusiasm, Openness, and Kindness. The page "[Being Axelerant](https://axelerant.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/1447493744/Being+Axelerant)" in our Open Handbook is a good read to cover these values and more.
