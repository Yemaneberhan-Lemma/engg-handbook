# Principles of Software Development at Axelerant

> "Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life." - Ray Dalio

A software engineer has to make a lot of decisions throughout their day. Defining and following certain _principles_ make it easier for you to make many of the decisions for challenges that have been solved previously. These are not set in stone but they have stood the test of time and you would rarely ignore a principle and only if there's a very good reason.

## Engineering Focus

Axelerant has traditionally been an Engineering focused company. We begin on strong fundamentals and aim to build a robust and useful solution. The solution needs to be robust so that our customers can trust it and it needs to be useful so that our customers derive value out of it. While we are focused on Engineering, we are still solving problems for people and that means we have to think of what our customers need.

## Build for people

We don't write code in a vacuum. We write code to solve problems for our customer, using systems used by their customers, all of which will be maintained by your teammates. We write code once but it is read many times and executed significantly more times.

### Solve the problem

You could write the most beautiful, most efficient, most poetic code you possibly can, but if it doesn't help your customer, it doesn't help anyone. Write great code and solve the problem.

### Write readable code

Do not try to be clever with your code. There is a saying that debugging is harder than writing code. So if you write the cleverest possible code then, by definition, you are not clever enough to debug it.

Write your code so that it can be read and understood by other people.

## Focus on Fundamentals



### Understand the technology deeply

#### Understand how computers work

#### Understand how Internet works

#### Understand how operating systems works

#### Understand programming languages

##### Distinguish types of programming languages

### Understand why we use anything

### Working with source code

#### Reading vs Writing code

## Ask for help

## Be bold and experiment

## Test, test, and test again

## Automate your way to laziness

## Be a part of the massive open-source community
