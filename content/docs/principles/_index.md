# Principles of Software Development at Axelerant

{{< blockquote author="Ray Dalio" quote="Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life." >}}

As software engineers, we have to make many decisions throughout the day. Defining and following certain _principles_ makes it easier for us to make many of the decisions for challenges that have been solved previously. These are not set in stone, but they have stood the test of time. We would rarely, if ever, ignore a principle.

{{< blockquote author="Steve Pereira, Flow Engineering" quote="Principles are supremely valuable in the context of engineering flow because they provide guidance to all people at all times. Principles guide effective action not only for individuals but for large groups of people. They are far more adaptive than any prescriptive method or playbook. Principles are generalizations that can readily be applied to many patterns." >}}

## Values

Before we discuss our principles in engineering, make sure you have understood our values of Enthusiasm, Openness, and Kindness. The page "[Being Axelerant](https://axelerant.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/1447493744/Being+Axelerant)" in our Open Handbook is a good read to cover these values and more.

Further to our three core values, we value excellence in our engineering.

{{< blockquote author="John C. Maxwell, The Leader's Greatest Return" quote="Excellence is the gradual result of always striving to do better." >}}

We have also talked about excellence [in a blog post](https://www.axelerant.com/blog/excellence) and many other places in our internal communications. In the knowledge industry, change is paramount, and striving to keep up with change is critical. Our pursuit of excellence allows us to do better in everything that we do.
