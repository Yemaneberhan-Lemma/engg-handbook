# Prototyping high risk items first

To minimize risk and identify architectural obstacles early on, high-risk tickets are prioritized while building sites. This involves identifying dependencies that may impact accomplishing the ticket and prototyping the workflow using "stub" data. This method should be used when starting a project or when the team has identified high-risk activities, but avoided when there are too many dependencies or not having enough of a backlog, as backlog help us to get a good sense of task priorities. It's important to consider possible extensions to functionality after setting the architecture based on high-risk tickets. Examples of high-risk tickets include complex permissions and search.
