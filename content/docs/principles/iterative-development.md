# Iterative Development

When we build software, we do so with the expectation that they will need to be updated and changed over time. This is because the needs of businesses and organizations are constantly evolving, and their software needs to reflect that. We design our systems with this in mind, using flexible and scalable solutions that can be easily adapted to meet changing needs.

## Agile with a Small A

We believe in agile development, which is a process of iterative development and continuous improvement. We work closely with our clients to gather their requirements and feedback, and we use this information to inform the development process. We also recognize that our clients' needs may change over the course of the project, and we are flexible enough to adapt to these changes.

## Reuse and Build

As mentioned [before]({{< relref "proudly-invented-elsewhere" >}}), we adopt off-the-shelf solutions so that we can focus on the [core value we are generating]({{< relref "high-risk-items" >}}). This can save time and money in the earlier cycles of iteration. This allows us to learn our constraints and requirements faster which allows us to revise our decisions.

When we are faced with a functional problem, we carefully consider all of the available solutions and choose the one that is most reliable and robust. We also try to avoid locking ourselves into a specific approach so that we can be flexible and adaptable in the future.
