# Begin with high-risk items

When dealing with unknown problems, it is useful to identify the high-risk tasks and work on them first. Usually, that is where most of the value lies. This avoids our tendency to pick up the tasks we are comfortable with first which generate very little value. Moreover, this is critical to avoid bikeshedding early in the process.

Practically, this is achieved by breaking down the problem into various tasks and focusing on those that generate unique value. There may be many dependencies and this is where our judgement should kick in. We should focus on just doing enough of those tasks so that we quickly get to the ones that we care about. Think of it as an MVP. Once we build what we want to build or solve the problem, proceed with the hardening of all the previous work.

## Tickets Prioritization

Our ticket prioritization system focuses on tackling critical issues first. This means addressing LIVE/Production problems immediately, fixing critical bugs regardless of environment, and prioritizing tickets related to upcoming client demos. Daily stand-up meetings play a crucial role in maintaining clarity on these priorities. During these meetings, we discuss ticket prioritization, communicate ongoing tasks to ensure everyone's aligned, review ticket classification for accuracy, and plan releases to effectively handle multiple tickets.
