# Begin with high-risk items

When dealing with unknown problems, it is useful to identify the high-risk tasks and work on them first. Usually, that is where most of the value lies. This avoids our tendencies to pick up the tasks we are comfortable with first which generate very little value. Moreover, this is critical to avoid bikeshedding early in the process.

Practically, this is achieved by breaking down the problem into various tasks and focus on those that generate unique value. There may be many dependencies and this is where our judgement should kick in. We should focus on just doing enough of those tasks so that we quickly get to the ones that we care about. Think of it as a MVP. Once we build what we wanted to build or solved the problem, proceed with the hardening of all the previous work.
