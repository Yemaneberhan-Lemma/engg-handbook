# Be a Part of the Massive Open-source Community

There's a very good chance you are not living in a remote jungle or a lonely mountaintop. That's because you have come to rely on the support (and comfort) provided by clusters of people in cities and towns. Why should our programming world be any different?

Open-source has been a transformative force in the software engineering industry. Chances are that this sentence might not even make sense to you because open-source is so ingrained in all the technology that we use daily. We choose to be a part of this open-source world because we know that is how we maximize our learning and our growth.
