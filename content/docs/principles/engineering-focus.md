# Engineering Focus

Axelerant has traditionally been an Engineering focused company. We begin on strong fundamentals and aim to build a robust and useful solution. The solution needs to be robust so that our customers can trust it and it needs to be useful so that our customers derive value out of it. While we are focused on Engineering, we are still solving problems for people and that means we have to think of what our customers need.
