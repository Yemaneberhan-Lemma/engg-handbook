# Automate your way to laziness

Life's too short to repeat things (I know I am repeating this but life's too short to find new maxims). Figure out a way to automate things you are doing repeatedly and frequently. This is crucial as we can then focus on things that generate the most value which are usually the things that can't be automated.

Automation solutions are often used to improve code quality, boost productivity, and foster collaboration. By leveraging automation, we can work smarter, not harder, and contribute to the development of high-quality solutions that meet the demands of the ever-evolving technological landscape.

We must understand the benefits and limitations of the current generation of Generative AI if we are serious about providing value in the world of information technology.
