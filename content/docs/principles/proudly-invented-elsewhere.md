# Proudly Invented Elsewhere

Software development is not new. Somebody has already faced a similar problem to what you are solving and solved it. Use libraries whenever you can. Even though a library might only meet 70-80% of our requirement, we consider using it.

We prefer using established libraries over writing custom code. This approach helps us keep our count of lines of code small and that means fewer bugs for us. Using these libraries also provides a learning opportunity from a worldwide community of programmers.

## DRY and WET Balance

Like all things, there is a [tradeoff]({{< relref "know-your-tradeoffs" >}}). Sometimes, using a third-party library may not be an option. If a lighter-weight approach can achieve the same functionality, or if the complexity of setup and configuration outweighs the benefits, it may be better for us to build the functionality ourselves.

Our goal is to balance maintainability, flexibility, and performance while leveraging the expertise and insights of other developers in the contribution community.
