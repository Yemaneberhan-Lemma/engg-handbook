# Build for People

We don't write code in a vacuum. We write code to solve problems for our customers using systems that their customers use, all of which will be maintained by our teammates. We write code once but it is read many times and executed many times more than it is read.

## Solve the problem {#solve}

You could write the most beautiful, most efficient, most poetic code you possibly can, but if it doesn't help our customers, it is useless. We write great code and solve the problem.

## Write readable code {#readable-code}

Do not try to be clever while writing code. There is a saying that debugging is harder than writing code. So if we write the cleverest possible code then, by definition, we are not clever enough to debug it.

We write our code so that it can be read and understood by other people.

## Continuous Improvement (Inspect and Adapt)

Continuous improvement is integral to maintaining and enhancing the quality and effectiveness of our work. By regularly stepping back from daily tasks to evaluate and refine our long-term strategies, we drive growth and excellence. This approach ensures we not only meet current project demands but also position ourselves for future success.

Enhancing client experiences is paramount. By delivering superior features and innovative solutions, we exceed expectations and forge enduring client relationships. Proactively assessing feedback and industry trends guides us in identifying opportunities to add substantial value.

In essence, we build for people by solving their problems and continuously improving how we do it. This ensures our solutions are not only effective today but also adaptable and scalable for the future.
