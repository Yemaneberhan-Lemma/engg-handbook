# Build for People

We don't write code in a vacuum. We write code to solve problems for our customers using systems that their customers use, all of which will be maintained by our teammates. We write code once but it is read many times and executed many times more than it is read.

## Solve the problem {#solve}

You could write the most beautiful, most efficient, most poetic code you possibly can, but if it doesn't help our customers, it is useless. We write great code and solve the problem.

## Write readable code {#readable-code}

Do not try to be clever while writing code. There is a saying that debugging is harder than writing code. So if we write the cleverest possible code then, by definition, we are not clever enough to debug it.

We write our code so that it can be read and understood by other people.
