# The Axelerant Way

The Axelerant Way is an opinionated way of working at Axelerant. It is meant to be prescriptive rather than mandatory. It aims to assist rather than take over your process. The core reason for building this is to reduce the repeated decisions engineers have to make when working on projects at Axelerant.

Our guideline in building this way is "progress, not perfection." We understand that it can't cater to everyone's needs. The prescriptive nature of the content here makes it possible for you to choose what you need. Give careful thought on each of the aspects covered here and decide if you need to deviate from the recommendations here for some reason.
