# Bridging Skill Gaps

Skill gaps are often encountered when working on a project and implementing a solution. This happens to everyone. Some have gaps in their coding fundamentals, some in their implementation of best practices and so-on and so-forth.

Identifying and filling skill gaps go hand-in-hand. When we are in project we learn and implement project tasks in parallel, when we are in bench-pool we try to learn in detail about a technology and implementations and get involved in the community through various activities (say, involved in contribution activities and giving back to Drupal.org by contributing projects, solving issues etc.) and prepare ourself for better tomorrow. And sometimes skill improvement is inevitable or it can be said that it becomes so important that we even borrow time from our busy lives and improve a particular skill(s).

We understand the importance of time and we never miss an opportunity to improve on skills or learn something new. We believe that ‘Asking for help, is a strength’ and we continue to openly discuss identified gaps with career managers, performance coaches and even team members and work on the concluded action items. As a team member, whether junior or senior, we do not hesitate to help each other learn something new, including sharing initial guidance and motivation when gaps are identified.

## Learning Management System(LMS)

The course materials available in our [LMS](<https://learning.axelerant.com>) supports a learning environment to understand the fundamentals around a particular topic.

We keep updating our LMS with new courses/contents and probably all topics may not be available at this point of time. Also, we prefer not re-inventing the wheel and hence in our LMS references to existing learning materials accessible over the internet(Example, Youtube, Drupalizeme etc.) is expected.
