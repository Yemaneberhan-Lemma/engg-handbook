# Quality as Teamwork

## Commitment to Quality

Being committed to providing a quality product is crucial in our development process. This commitment ensures that our QA team can focus more on edge cases rather than basic functionality. Each team member should strive to deliver high-quality code and solutions, reducing the likelihood of defects and enhancing overall project quality.

## Clarity and Completeness

Before taking up any ticket, it is essential to ensure that each aspect is clear and unambiguous. This includes the scope, acceptance criteria, implementation details, and estimations. A well-defined ticket helps avoid misunderstandings and ensures that all team members are on the same page, leading to smoother project execution and better outcomes.

## Status Updates

Maintaining updated tickets with the current status is vital for effective project management. Ensure that tickets are regularly updated and assigned to the concerned person. This practice helps in tracking progress, identifying bottlenecks, and facilitating timely interventions, thereby keeping the project on schedule.

## Developer Testing

Developer testing is a critical step in our quality assurance process. Make sure that thorough testing is conducted for all positive scenarios as per the test plan before passing the ticket to QA. This initial testing helps in identifying and resolving issues early, reducing the load on QA and speeding up the overall testing process.

## Collaboration and Openness

Fostering a collaborative environment is key to our success. Be open to suggestions and inputs from the team, and work together to improve our processes and solutions. Teamwork and effective communication can lead to innovative ideas and better problem-solving, ultimately enhancing the quality and efficiency of our projects.

By adhering to these principles, we can ensure that our engineering efforts are aligned with our commitment to delivering high-quality products, maintaining clear communication, and fostering a collaborative work environment.
