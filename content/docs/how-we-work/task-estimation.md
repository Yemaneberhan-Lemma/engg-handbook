# Task Estimation

In our Agile projects, estimates define the work size we need to meet acceptance criteria or project milestones. Story points, rather than hours, are commonly used for estimation. That needs to be communicated explicitly since Story Points are not equal to hours. Story points measure overall effort, considering complexity, work volume, and risk. They help us improve estimation accuracy and enhance overall project delivery.

Estimating software engineering tasks is multifaceted, involving factors like complexity, team expertise, and resources. We have best practices such as breaking tasks into smaller components for accurate estimation, leveraging historical data with validation, and engaging team members for diverse perspectives and early issue identification.

We can apply different estimation techniques. We can estimate during sprint planning meetings. We can also use techniques like Planning Poker. In Planning Poker, the team votes on the effort required (in story points) for a task. Through discussion and explanation of extreme estimates, the team aims for a consensus, revealing hidden complexities and improving estimates over time. In our projects, it is less recommended to have pre-determined estimates to be reviewed later with the team.
