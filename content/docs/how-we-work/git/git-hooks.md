# Git hooks

[Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) are scripts that are triggered during certain Git events, such as committing, pushing, or merging code changes. Git hooks can be useful for enforcing coding standards, running tests, or performing other automated tasks. Developers can write custom hooks to fit their specific project needs, or use pre-existing hooks that are provided by Git or third-party sources. Git hooks allow more consistency in the project's development process. The use of Git hooks can help ensure that code changes follow the project's guidelines and standards, leading to a more organized, efficient, and reliable codebase.
