# Working with Git

Version control is a staple part of the development cycle and it is important we (the entire team) understand it properly. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is one of most fundamental skills of any programmer.

While there are multiple types of version control systems available, we have defaulted to using git in all cases. It is ubiquitous and the only difference among teams is where the repository is hosted and what kind of branching workflow is followed. At Axelerant, we always use git, mostly work with Github, and encourage trunk-based development workflows.
