# Estimation Techniques

Effective project execution relies on accurate estimation. Different estimation techniques serve various objectives, from providing broad ranges to sorting and prioritizing work efficiently.

## T-Shirt Sizing

[T-shirt sizing](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing) assigns XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL sizes to tasks, moving teams away from traditional time-based estimates (hours, days). This technique aids in initial triage and involves non-technical stakeholders in the estimation process. It’s especially useful when precise estimates aren’t possible but a rough idea is needed for planning capacity or long-term project strategies.

## Three-Point Estimation

[Three-point estimation](https://nulab.com/learn/project-management/3-point-estimating) involves assigning three values (in hours or story points): pessimistic, optimistic, and most likely. The optimistic estimate assumes everything goes perfectly, the pessimistic estimate considers potential delays, and the most likely estimate is based on best judgment. Formulas for calculating these estimates typically weigh the most likely scenario more heavily, providing a balanced average. Examples include:

- (optimistic estimate + 4 x most likely estimate + pessimistic estimate) ÷ 6

- (optimistic + pessimistic + most likely) / 3

## Planning Poker [Recommended during Sprints]

[Planning poker](https://www.easyagile.com/blog/planning-poker-agile/) is an engaging technique where team members estimate tasks in units of story points (or hours). Each member guesses the effort required and then votes simultaneously. Votes are discussed to reach a consensus, encouraging individual assessment and collective agreement. This method is particularly useful once tasks have been prioritized and broken down, ready for final execution estimates. We can use apps like [PlanITpoker](https://planitpoker.com/) that can assist us in estimating projects.

## Affinity Grouping

[Affinity grouping](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/affinity-grouping-definition-examples) sorts tasks based on their similarities in scope, effort, or complexity. Tasks are grouped until clear sets emerge, which can then be organized into epics. This high-level technique helps in planning by categorizing related work, such as grouping all payment-related tasks or complex tasks requiring significant effort.

## Dot Voting

[Dot voting](https://dotmocracy.org/), similar to Planning Poker, involves team members assigning dots to tasks to indicate complexity. More dots signify higher complexity. This technique visually represents team consensus on task difficulty.
