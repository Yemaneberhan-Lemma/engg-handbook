# Security

Security is an everlasting concern in the world of software engineering. Understanding what security means in the context of your work and the various vectors which might be responsible to compromise your system's security is extremely important.

That said, security is a wide and deep topic and a single person cannot hope to span the width and depth of this challenging area. It is the team's responsibility to understand security at various levels and implement safeguards.

For example, an application relies on database credentials to connect to the database. There can be API keys using which the application communicates with the third-party service. They must not be kept in the repository. There should not even be a Git commit referring to those credentials. They can be misused if a malicious user gets hold of them. Use the environment variables or vaults for storing and retrieving them.

## Server and Website Security

In particular, we practice server and site security by using only sanitized databases, taking care not to install restricted access files on development or personal instances outside the project defined security accreditation boundary and scrubbing unneeded data from our development systems
And as developers, we follow technology specific coding standards and best practices and write secure code as per the respective communityâ€™s guidelines.

We minimize custom code, always preferring to use community maintained modules. And in general, we use stable versions of third-party libraries, including modules maintained by the community. It is important to note that alpha, beta, dev, and rc versions are not considered stable releases. And in our experience, in many cases, it is preferable to run a dev release over alpha/beta releases, where there have been a significant number of bug fixes and the security profile is identical.

We periodically audit sites to determine if any security issues have been reported or if the set of enabled libraries/modules are all still in use on the site.

### Drupal Specific As Drupal Developers

- We follow [Drupal coding standards and best practices](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards)

- We write [Secure Code in Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/administering-a-drupal-site/security-in-drupal)

### Privileged Access

We ensure that access to documents, sites, and/or dashboards is limited to those that should have access; this includes our Google Workspace.

We ensure that users with enhanced privileges (to sites and/or servers) must use TFA for authentication/authorization are appropriately adjusted upon separation from Axelerant.

### Continuous Monitoring

While we work on a project, we use tools to support continuous monitoring for performance and efficiency and to ensure proper operation and security.
