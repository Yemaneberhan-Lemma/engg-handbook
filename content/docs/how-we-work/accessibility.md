# Accessibility

In an increasingly digital world, our commitment to accessibility is not just a necessity—it's a strategic choice. As we navigate the landscape of technology, we stand as architects of change, sculpting solutions that comply with legal standards and are ethical statements of our dedication to diversity and inclusion.

At Axelerant, we believe the digital world should be accessible to everyone. We are committed to creating digital solutions that break down barriers. In this space, we don't just talk about making things work; we talk about making them work for everyone.

## Legal and Regulatory Landscape

Navigating the legal and regulatory landscape is pivotal for any service provider committed to excellence in digital accessibility. At Axelerant, we understand the importance of compliance and ethical practices. Our primary approach aligns with essential internationally recognized standards, which include [EN 301 549](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard) and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/).

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), an internationally recognized set of guidelines, ensures accessible digital content. Adhering to WCAG is not just a legal obligation; it demonstrates a commitment to excellence in creating universally accessible experiences. At Axelerant, we strictly follow [WCAG 2.2 AA/AAA standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) for all our digital assets, integrating accessibility throughout the development process. Accessibility is not an afterthought but an integral part of our comprehensive strategies, from requirements to deployment.

## POUR Principles

We always take into account the [four principles of accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#later-versions-of-accessibility-guidelines) (namely perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust, also called POUR principles), which are a set of guidelines designed to ensure that web content is accessible to all users.

## Why Digital Accessibility?

We believe digital accessibility brings a multitude of ethical and business benefits.
By prioritizing inclusivity and respecting diverse users, we demonstrate our commitment to equality. This fosters enhanced user experiences, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, ensuring equal access to opportunities facilitates market expansion, tapping into new demographics and revenue streams.
Upholding integrity and transparency in our practices builds brand trust and reputation, creating a competitive edge as an accessibility champion.
We always meet legal requirements, which not only showcase social responsibility but also mitigate legal risks, providing a secure operating environment. By embracing digital accessibility as an innovation catalyst, it enables us to be industry leaders through innovative and human-centric approaches.

## Our Solutions and Approach

At Axelerant, we follow "shift left" and "shift right" approaches. We adopt a "shift left" approach to ensure the early integration of digital accessibility from the initial planning and requirements analysis stages. By doing so, we aim to catch and address potential issues early, preventing the need for extensive retroactive fixes. Conversely, we implement a "shift right" approach, focusing on post-deployment monitoring and continuous improvement. Through this approach, we remain vigilant after the product launch, actively monitoring user feedback, tracking accessibility metrics, and swiftly addressing emerging issues.
