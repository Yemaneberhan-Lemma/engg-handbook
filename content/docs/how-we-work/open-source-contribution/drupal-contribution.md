4. Start with a novice task

   These issues has been tagged by contributors and maintainer with novice tag. These are good task for first contribution. That means, they’re easy to understood. Changes will be easily accept, and will give you a good complete experience of contribution process.

5. Be collaborative

   Follow along with the existing contributions.

   - If others are working on merge request, you should work on merge request.
   - If you are proposing a new solution, you can create a new branch and create merge request.
   - You can switch to a Merge request from patches, but only if you’re making a change.
   - Do not just convert an existing merge request without any other change.
     Respect maintainer and other contributor feedback
   - Maintainers and other contributors will try to help you. But if you don’t respond to their feedback, or go repeat the same problem in a different issue that will be a problem.
   - If the maintainer gives you feedback to do something differently, acknowledge the feedback and change your contribution style.
   - If you don't follow maintainers feedback you just risk a temporary ban.

6. Attribute your work to Axelerant technologies
   Don't forgot to add Axelerant as your organization and Drupal India Association as your customer.
