# Drupal Contribution

## How to Start Contributions

### Create a Drupal.org Account

To contribute to Drupal, start by creating a Drupal.org account. This account is our gateway to engaging with the community, participating in discussions, and contributing to the platform's development.

Go to [Create a Drupal. org account](https://www.drupal.org/user/register) then you need to:

- Confirm the new account (i.e., trusted colleagues)
- Fill out your profile information
  - Bio, picture, location, languages
  - Contributor roles
  - Events attended
  - Mentors
  - Developer: Git access
- Add your organization (Axelerant) to your profile.

### Working on issues

You can find all issues related to the module, theme, or Core in the sidebar of the project.

#### Start with a novice task

These issues have been tagged by contributors and maintainers with the novice tag. These are good tasks for the first contribution. That means they’re easy to understand. Changes will be easily accepted and will give you a good, complete experience of the contribution process.

You should choose the first issue as an existing issue only. [Read more](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/novice)

Before working on these issues, it is recommended to understand the issue etiquette and credit policy.

### Issue Etiquette and Credit System

When contributing to Drupal, it is essential to know the Drupal [issue etiquette](https://www.drupal.org/issue-etiquette), - which elaborates on what to do and what not to do. If the contribution matters, it can obtain fair credit based on the [credit policy](https://www.drupal.org/about/core/policies/maintainers/how-is-credit-granted-for-drupal-core-issues) or guidelines.

#### Abuse of the Contribution Credit System and its Consequences

When contributing to Drupal, we need to be cautious that the contribution is not considered an [abuse of the credit system](https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/marketplace/abuse-of-the-contribution-credit-system#:~:text=Organization%20pages-,Abuse%20of%20the%20Contribution%20Credit%20system,-Last%20updated%20on), which has different [consequences](https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/marketplace/abuse-of-the-contribution-credit-system#:~:text=for%20bad%20behavior.-,What%20are%20the%20consequences%20for%20abuse%20of%20the%20credit%20system%3F,-For%20individuals) for individuals and organizations.

Individuals may receive a temporary block to prevent credit spamming, with the aim of helping them become authentic contributors, and may receive educational material. If educational materials are ignored, the block may be extended.

Organizations face more serious consequences, including negative credits to nullify the value of farming and temporary delisting from the marketplace. After the first warning, educational materials are sent. A second warning results in negative credit and a warning of potential delisting for up to a week. A third warning increases the negative credit and the potential delisting period to a month. A fourth warning applies negative credit again and warns of indefinite delisting, requiring the organization to work with the Drupal Association on a remediation plan.

### Be collaborative

Follow along with the existing contributions.

- If others are working on merge requests, you should work on merge requests.
- If you are proposing a new solution, you can create a new branch and create a merge request.
- You can switch to a Merge request from patches, but only if you’re making a change.
- Do not just convert an existing merge request without any other changes.
- Respect maintainer and other contributor feedback.
- Maintainers and other contributors will try to help you. But if you don’t respond to their feedback or go back and repeat the same problem in a different issue, that will be a problem.
- If the maintainer gives you feedback to do something differently, acknowledge the feedback and change your contribution style.
- If you don't follow the maintainer's feedback, you just risk a temporary ban.

### Attribute your work to Axelerant technologies

Don't forget to add Axelerant as your organization and Drupal India Association as your customer.
