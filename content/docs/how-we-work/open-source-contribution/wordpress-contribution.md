### Finding Contribution Tasks

- Custom plugins built while working on WordPress websites can be generalized and contributed.

- Check out the Axelerant-supported plugins with all the information here to collaborate internally with team members. Some quick points to remember:

  - Make sure you follow the [standard repository fork and merge request model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to contribute to the project.

  - Check with the plugin creator to get write access to the repository or developer access on [WordPress.org](https://wordPress.org).

  - Check out the internal release process documented [here](https://axelerant.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASD/pages/1425899525/WordPress+Plugin+Release+Process) and the following repositories [1](https://github.com/michael-cannon/skel), [2](https://github.com/michael-cannon/skel-custom).

  - [Follow the official process to contribute a plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/article/contributing-to-wordpress/)

- If you have worked on an HTML/CSS template, you can convert it into a WordPress theme and contribute.

- In case you have integrated a third-party service with WordPress for which a plugin wasnâ€™t available, that plugin can be contributed.
