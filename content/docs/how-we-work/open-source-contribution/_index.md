# Open Source Contribution

At Axelerant, our approach to open source contributions is guided by our values. We understand that growth is ongoing, and our work on various projects often reveals opportunities to expand our knowledge. We prioritize continuous learning and improvement. Open source contribution is one of the key elements in our mission of learning and improvement. Whether we're actively engaged in projects or participating in community initiatives, we contribute with dedication and a sense of responsibility. This not only enhances our expertise but also allows us to give back to the open source community, aligning with our mission to make a positive impact. In this way, we uphold the Axelerant way of contributing and our commitment to excellence.

Open source contributions involve collaborating on free and open software projects to enhance and create software for anyone to use. It allows developers like us to give back to the community, improve our skills, and make a significant impact on the world of technology.

Open Source depends on the spirit of collaboration across individual and across organizations.

Instead of building individual solutions, we can build one bigger and better solution together.

## Types of Contributions

### Code Contributions

As developers, code contributions are the main part of our open source contributions. These contributions can take many forms, including improving existing modules or themes through testing, fixing bugs, and adding new features. We can also contribute by creating new modules or themes or by open-sourcing existing private ones. Providing tools to improve the developer experience is another way to contribute. We contribute to the core functionalities or code of an open source project as well, helping to shape its future development. All of these types of code contributions can significantly improve the quality and functionality of open-source systems.

### Non-code Contributions

We have many ways to make open source contributions besides writing code. Some examples include contributing to documentation, organizing events, providing mentorship, writing blog posts, and developing promotional materials. All of these contributions can greatly benefit a project and help it thrive.

Furthermore, we can participate in community events like conferences, camps, and meetups, which have informal contribution opportunities. We can also be involved in updating the documentation. However, contributions that can be done by automation or bots, such as patch re-rolls and merge request rebase, may not receive credit. We can also contribute by promoting via social media to create awareness.

## Why contribute to Open Source?

Contributing allows us to learn and practice writing clean, readable, and maintainable code, enhancing our efficiency and earning recognition in the developer community. Immersing ourselves in a technology's codebase provides a deep understanding of its intricacies, offering insights into long-term project cost-effectiveness and inspiring innovation. This active involvement becomes a valuable addition to our resume and portfolio.
Facing an issue within a Project/module prompts us to find solutions, submitting patches/Pull requests for resolution. We willingly assist others in the open-source community, sharing knowledge through comments and creating new projects for generic solutions. Our belief in collaborative power and shared knowledge drives us.
For a better contribution experience, communication with the contribution team is encouraged.

## Contribution Guidelines

In open-source collaboration, adhering to established guidelines is paramount. Submitting empty merge requests, unnecessary rerolls, or reposting patches without providing clear explanations must be avoided. Rigorous testing, prompt feedback responses, and timely resolution of blockers are essential for successful open-source collaboration. It is encouraged to post thoughtfully about low-effort issues and carefully consider the impact of AI-generated code on the project. Responsible use of automated tools is recommended to streamline tasks without compromising quality. Cultivate respect for maintainers, adhere to etiquette, and uphold community standards to foster a harmonious and productive open-source environment. Report security issues through designated channels and avoid disrupting discussions by "hijacking" or spamming community forums. Opening a merge request without any code is discouraged, as it hinders the review process and delays progress.

When contributing to open-source communities, it is essential to avoid duplicate issues. Clear and descriptive problem statements are prioritized to ensure effective communication and resolution. It is vital to ensure that contributions are meaningful and add value to the project, rather than merely aiming for participation numbers. Quality should always take precedence over quantity. Adopting a one-issue-per-pull-request strategy improves the review process, promotes collaborative efficiency, and contributes to a more streamlined and effective open-source community.
