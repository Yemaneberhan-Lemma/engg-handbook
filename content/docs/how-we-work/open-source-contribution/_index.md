# Open Source Contribution

At Axelerant, our approach to open source contributions is guided by our values. We understand that growth is ongoing, and our work on various projects often reveals opportunities to expand our knowledge. To seize these opportunities, we prioritize continuous learning and improvement. Whether we're actively engaged in projects or participating in community initiatives, we do so with dedication and a sense of responsibility. This not only enhances our expertise but also allows us to give back to the open source community, aligning with our mission to make a positive impact. In this way, we uphold the Axelerant way of contributing and our commitment to excellence.

Open source contributions involve collaborating on free and open software projects to enhance and create software for anyone to use. It allows developers like us to give back to the community, improve our skills, and make a significant impact on the world of technology.

Open Source depends upon the spirit of collaboration across individual and across organizations.

Instead of building individual solutions we can build one bigger and better solution together.

## Types of Contributions

### Code Contributions

- Helping improve existing modules/themes(tests, bugs, new features).

- Creating new modules or open source existing private modules/themes.

- Sharing tool to improve developer experience (ddev, drupalpod, composer patches… all come from the Drupal community).

- Contribution to Drupal core.

### Non-code Contributions

- Documentation

- Event organizing

- Mentorship

- Blog posts

- Promotional materials for Drupal

### Why should we contribute?

When we contribute, we easily learn how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. This not only makes our work more efficient but also earns us recognition and appreciation within the developer community. As we immerse ourselves in the codebase of the technology we're using to build our applications, we gain a profound understanding of its intricacies. This deep dive allows us to gauge the long-term cost-effectiveness of our projects and offers insights into what other developers are doing, giving us the freedom to extend and innovate as needed. This enabled us to add a noticeable point to our resume and build an outstanding portfolio.
