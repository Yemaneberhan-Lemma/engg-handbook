# Open Source Contribution

At Axelerant, our approach to open source contributions is guided by our values. We understand that growth is ongoing, and our work on various projects often reveals opportunities to expand our knowledge. We prioritize continuous learning and improvement. Open source contribution is one of the key elements in our mission of learning and improvement. Whether we're actively engaged in projects or participating in community initiatives, we contribute with dedication and a sense of responsibility. This not only enhances our expertise but also allows us to give back to the open source community, aligning with our mission to make a positive impact. In this way, we uphold the Axelerant way of contributing and our commitment to excellence.

Open source contributions involve collaborating on free and open software projects to enhance and create software for anyone to use. It allows developers like us to give back to the community, improve our skills, and make a significant impact on the world of technology.

Open Source depends on the spirit of collaboration across individual and across organizations.

Instead of building individual solutions, we can build one bigger and better solution together.

## Types of Contributions

### Code Contributions

As developers, code contributions are the main part of our open source contributions. These contributions can take many forms, including improving existing modules or themes through testing, fixing bugs, and adding new features. We can also contribute by creating new modules or themes or by open-sourcing existing private ones. Providing tools to improve the developer experience is another way to contribute. We contribute to the core functionalities or code of an open source project as well, helping to shape its future development. All of these types of code contributions can significantly improve the quality and functionality of open-source systems.

### Non-code Contributions

We have many ways to make open source contributions besides writing code. Some examples include contributing to documentation, organizing events, providing mentorship, writing blog posts, and developing promotional materials. All of these contributions can greatly benefit a project and help it thrive.

Furthermore, we can participate in community events like cons, camps, and meetups, which have informal contribution opportunities. We can also update documentation, including docs on drupal.org and inline code documentation. However, contributions that can be done by automation or bots, such as patch re-rolls and merge request rebase, may not receive credit. Another way to contribute is by volunteering at open source community camps or events, such as by adding content to camp or conference websites. We can also contribute by promoting it via social media to create awareness of its features and benefits.

### Why should we contribute?

When we contribute, we easily learn how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. This not only makes our work more efficient but also earns us recognition and appreciation within the developer community. As we immerse ourselves in the codebase of the technology we're using to build our applications, we gain a profound understanding of its intricacies. This deep dive allows us to gauge the long-term cost-effectiveness of our projects and offers insights into what other developers are doing, giving us the freedom to extend and innovate as needed. This enabled us toÂ add a noticeable point to our resume and build an outstanding portfolio.

We can communicate with the contribution team to help us have a better contribution experience.
