# Drupal SEO

We configure sites that are optimized for SEO, which improves their visibility on search engines like Google.

One of the major options for implementing SEO is the use of specific modules that can enhance a site’s search engine performance. For instance, the [XML Sitemap](https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap) module creates a map of your site that helps search engines understand its structure and efficiently crawl through its pages. The [Google Analytics](https://www.drupal.org/project/google_analytics) module integrates our site with Google’s analytics tool, providing valuable insights into how visitors interact with our site. The [Metatag](https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag) module allows us to add meta tags to our site, which are snippets of text that describe a page’s content and can influence how your website is understood and displayed by search engines.

Another useful module is [Pathauto](https://www.drupal.org/project/pathauto), which automatically generates URL aliases for various types of content on our site. Proper configuration of this module is crucial because URLs play an important role in SEO. The [Redirect](https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect) module is also essential as it allows you to set up URL redirects, preventing “page not found” errors when pages are moved or renamed. There is also [Yoast SEO](https://www.drupal.org/project/yoast_seo), a module that helps optimize content around keywords in a fast, natural, non-spam way. It works together with the Metatag module and provides real-time page analysis to ensure your content is loved by both search engines and users.

We conduct keyword research during the discovery phase of the project. Keywords are the words and phrases that people type into search engines, and by understanding what keywords are relevant to our clients’ businesses, we can help them create content that will attract the right kind of visitors.
